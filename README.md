Software testing homework

## Running tests
* Install Mozilla Firefox web browser

* Download and unzip geckodriver executable from
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

* Place `geckodriver` or `geckodriver.exe` (on Windows) executable into the directory
'src/test/resources'

* Provide access to YouTrack via localhost:8080 with an existing user with
the name `root` and the password `root`

* The YouTrack instance may have other existing projects, users and issues, **but there should be no concurrent operations**

* Although there are no known flaky tests, it's possible that there will be some of them in your environment, so, if the tests fail, try to run them one more time.
